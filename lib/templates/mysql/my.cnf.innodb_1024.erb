# my.cnf.innodb_1024
#
# This is a MySQL 5.x configuration file designed for the typical
# webapp, running on a 1GB server that is also the app and 
# httpd server. The below configuration dedicates about half of 
# the system resources to MySQL. It is InnoDB-specific, and 
# will not perform well with many MyISAM tables. It supports 
# limited ACID and referential integrity. It does not support 
# replication.
